## `𝚆𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚒𝚜 𝚊 𝚂𝚌𝚘𝚙𝚎𝚍 𝚂𝚝𝚘𝚛𝚊𝚐𝚎`💡
🏷️ We are aware that working with a file system is a very important part of android development. Till the android `version-10`, once the user gave permission to access the external storage, he could access any file on the device.</br>
🏷️ But most of the time we don't need the entire storage system to be accessed. Users mostly do some action on a file or a group of files and don't need access to the entire file system, due to this there was a concern of security and privacy of the user.</br>
🏷️ The scoped storage enhances the control of user privacy on the device.
